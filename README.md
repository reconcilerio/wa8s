## Overview

### Components

The `components` package contains the core building blocks to resolve, compose, publish and create static components.

### Registries

The `registries` package defines OCI repositories where components can be published. 

By default an authenticated `ClusterRepository` is provided. It's hosted in cluster as a scratch space for intermediate components. State in this repository is ephemerial. Components must be published to a durable repository before they are consumed outside of wa8s.

### Containers

The `containers` package converts a component into a traditional OCI container, typically with [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev) embedded. Using containers is a compatibility layer to run within environments that don't natively support wasm components.

Running a container requires publishing the container image to a repository the cluster is able to pull from. The default registry is not accessible to the cluster.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

[`cert-manager`](https://cert-manager.io) and [`reconciler.io/ducks`](https://github.com/reconcilerio/ducks) are required in the cluster. They can be installed via `make deploy-cert-manager` and `make deploy-ducks` for default configurations.

### Deploy a released build

The easiest way to get started is by deploying the [latest release](https://github.com/reconcilerio/wa8s/releases). Alternatively, you can [build from source](#build-from-source).

### Build from source

1. Define where to publish images:

   ```sh
   export KO_DOCKER_REPO=<a-repository-you-can-write-to>
   ```

   For kind, a registry is not required (or run `make kind-deploy`):

   ```sh
   export KO_DOCKER_REPO=kind.local
   ```
	
1. Build and deploy the controller to the cluster:

   Note: The cluster must have the [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) deployed.  There is a `make deploy-cert-manager` target to deploy the cert-manager.

   ```sh
   make deploy
   ```

#### Undeploy controller
Undeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```
